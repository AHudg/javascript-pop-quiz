                From far and wide, we convene here today to see who will take home the championship title of “JavaScript Master”. This is a timed quiz filled with questions centered around JavaScript code and best practices. Incorrect answers will deduce 10 seconds from the timer, while correct answers will boost your score by 5 seconds. The quiz will end once you've successfully answered all quiz questions or run out of time! If you perform well, you just might make it to the leaderboard and claim the prize of “JavaScript Master”!
                </br> Good luck and have fun!</p>
